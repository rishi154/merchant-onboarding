# Missing Strategy Components in Our AI Agent Approach

## 🚨 **Critical Gaps Identified**

Based on market leader strategies, our current AI agent approach is missing several key components that are essential for achieving 1-2 day processing times.

---

## 1. **Merchant Segmentation Strategy - MAJOR GAP**

### **What We're Missing:**
```
❌ No explicit merchant type segmentation in our agent design
❌ Single application flow for all merchant types
❌ No segment-specific risk thresholds or processes
❌ No pre-qualification based on merchant characteristics
```

### **What We Need to Add:**

#### **New Agent: Merchant Segmentation Agent**
```
Purpose: Classify merchants into processing segments before application starts
Location: Should be FIRST agent (before Lead Qualification)

Segments:
├── Instant Approval Segment (40-60% of merchants)
│   ├── Standard retail (restaurants, shops, e-commerce)
│   ├── Established businesses (>2 years, good credit)
│   ├── Low-risk industries (retail, professional services)
│   └── Simple business structures (sole proprietor, simple LLC)
│
├── Fast Track Segment (20-30% of merchants)  
│   ├── Known industries with standard risk profiles
│   ├── Medium complexity businesses (partnerships, franchises)
│   ├── Good credit but newer businesses (6 months - 2 years)
│   └── Moderate risk industries (hospitality, healthcare)
│
└── Enhanced Review Segment (10-20% of merchants)
    ├── High-risk industries (cannabis, adult entertainment, crypto)
    ├── Complex structures (holding companies, trusts)
    ├── International or multi-state operations
    └── Poor credit or compliance history
```

#### **Modified Application Assistant Agent:**
```
Current: Single application flow for all merchants
Needed: Segment-specific application flows

Instant Approval Flow:
- Minimal 5-minute application
- Basic business info + bank account
- Automated document collection
- Real-time approval/decline

Fast Track Flow:
- Standard 15-minute application  
- Additional business details
- Enhanced document requirements
- 24-48 hour processing

Enhanced Review Flow:
- Comprehensive 30-45 minute application
- Extensive documentation requirements
- Manual underwriter assignment
- 5-10 day processing timeline
```
