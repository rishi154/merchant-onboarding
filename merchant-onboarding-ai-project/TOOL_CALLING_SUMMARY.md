# Tool Calling Implementation Summary

## Current Status: IMPLEMENTED ✓

The merchant onboarding system now has **real tool calling** implemented where LLMs can dynamically decide which tools to use and when.

## What is Real Tool Calling?

**Before (NOT real tool calling):**
```python
# LLM just returns JSON based on prompts
result = await llm.ainvoke({"data": json.dumps(data)})
```

**After (REAL tool calling):**
```python
# LLM analyzes task, chooses tools, calls them, processes results
agent = create_tool_calling_agent(llm, tools, prompt)
agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools)
result = await agent_executor.ainvoke(input_data)
```

## Implemented Tool Calling Agents

### 1. Compliance Verification Agent ✓
- **Tools Available:** OFAC Sanctions, PEP Screening, AML Risk Assessment, KYC Verification
- **LLM Decides:** Which compliance checks to run based on merchant profile
- **Real Integration:** Connects to mock regulatory services
- **Fallback:** Direct tool usage if LLM fails

### 2. Data Validation Agent ✓
- **Tools Available:** Business Registry Lookup, Tax ID Validation, Address Verification
- **LLM Decides:** Which validation checks to perform based on data quality
- **Real Integration:** Connects to mock government databases
- **Fallback:** Direct validation logic if tools fail

## Available Tools

### Compliance Tools
1. **OFACSanctionsTool** - Check against sanctions lists
2. **PEPScreeningTool** - Screen for politically exposed persons
3. **AMLRiskAssessmentTool** - Anti-money laundering risk scoring
4. **KYCVerificationTool** - Know your customer identity verification

### Validation Tools
1. **BusinessRegistryTool** - Verify business registration with Secretary of State
2. **TaxIdValidationTool** - Validate Tax ID/EIN with IRS
3. **AddressVerificationTool** - Verify and standardize addresses with USPS

## How It Works

1. **Agent Receives Task** - Gets merchant application data
2. **LLM Analyzes Requirements** - Determines what verification is needed
3. **LLM Selects Tools** - Chooses appropriate tools based on analysis
4. **Tools Execute** - Connect to external services (mocked for development)
5. **LLM Processes Results** - Analyzes tool outputs and makes decisions
6. **Agent Returns Assessment** - Provides comprehensive compliance/validation results

## Key Benefits

- **Dynamic Decision Making** - LLM chooses tools based on merchant profile
- **Real External Connections** - Tools connect to actual services (mocked for dev)
- **Multi-step Reasoning** - Can call multiple tools in sequence
- **Adaptive Workflow** - Tool selection varies by merchant needs
- **Reliable Fallbacks** - Direct tool usage if LLM reasoning fails

## Test Results

- **Individual Tools:** WORKING ✓
- **Agent Tool Calling:** WORKING ✓
- **Fallback Logic:** WORKING ✓
- **Mock Integrations:** WORKING ✓

## Next Steps

1. **Connect Real APIs** - Replace mock services with actual regulatory APIs
2. **Add More Tools** - Expand tool library for additional verification needs
3. **Optimize Tool Selection** - Fine-tune LLM prompts for better tool choices
4. **Add Tool Caching** - Cache tool results to improve performance

The tool calling implementation is **complete and functional**. The LLMs can now dynamically select and use tools based on the specific requirements of each merchant application.
